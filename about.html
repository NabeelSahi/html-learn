        <h1>About CIS</h1>
        <h2>The Council of International Schools (CIS) is a membership community committed to high quality international education.</h2>
        <p>As a global non-profit membership organisation, CIS provides services to primary and secondary schools, higher education institutions and individuals that share these ideals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a desire to provide students with the knowledge, skills and abilities to pursue their lives as global citizens; and</li>
          <li>a commitment to high quality international education.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To achieve this goal, our members must infuse their programmes and offerings with international and intercultural perspective so that students can move forward with the attitudes and understanding that will provide them with a solid base wherever their studies or work may take them.  Primary and secondary school members must further commit to undertaking an ongoing external quality assurance process to enhance student learning.

The CIS community includes more than 660 schools and 475 colleges and universities representing 109 countries.</p>
        <h3>Global Citizenship</h3>
