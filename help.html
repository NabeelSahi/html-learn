     <h3>Learn and live the language</h3>
     <p>
     CIS has an extensive network of schools located around the world . You can learn English in one of our schools in England, Canada, the USA, Malta, New Zealand or Australia. We also have language centres in France and Switzerland. CIS also works with partner language schools in Spain, Italy, Russia, Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica. Since 1965, we have taught thousands of students from all parts of the world. All our schools are modern and equipped with the latest technology. They are in the centre of attractive city destinations. General language courses at CIS provide language training in a group environment. These programmes will improve all areas of your language skills. You can also choose to specialise in a number of different areas. Exam courses at CIS develop your exam skills in a group environment. These programmes provide language training and prepare you for the examination. Junior language courses at CIS are ideal for small groups or individual young people.

     <h3>Exam Preparation Programmes</h3>
     <p>
     In many countries around the world the Cambridge examinations are accepted by companies and academic institutions as proof of competence in English, and are highly regarded by employers.Over the years CIS students have enjoyed a high success rate in these examinations. You can prepare for these examinations, which are offered at three different levels, in most of our CIS Language Centres. Our staff members and teachers will be happy to advise you which examination is most suitable for you.

      <h3>English for Business Courses</h3>
      <p>
      English is the international language of business. We have therefore developed a special, flexible, 12 module course designed to rapidly improve your business communication skills.Every 12 weeks, we recycle the modules with a fresh syllabus. This means students who wish to study longer and consolidate and expand their knowledge of a particular area, can do so without repeating any material.
