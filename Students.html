        <h1>Student Recruitment Tours</h1>
        <p>
          For more than 40 years, CIS and a team of dedicated member volunteers have been organising undergraduate student recruitment tours around the world for admission and recruitment officers from CIS Higher Education Member institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why should you travel on a CIS Student Recruitment Tour? 
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Our focus is entirely on undergraduate recruitment. Meet students interested in international education opportunities.</li>
        <li>Our tour leaders are all experienced admissions counselors working at CIS member institutions. They understand your needs and goals.</li>
        <li>Our high quality fairs only include invited students from CIS Member schools and other schools we know. These private fairs provide a great opportunity for quality interactions.</li>
        <li>Counsellor Fly-ins provide opportunities for even more networking.</li>
        <li>Our tours feel like a mini-conference. Daily interactions with admissions professionals from other CIS member institutions allow you to learn from the experiences of others, share ideas and build your network.</li>
        <li>Inclusive pricing covers all logistics and events. There are no surprise bills or fees.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Student Recruitment Fairs</h3>
      <p>
        CIS offers a wide range of student recruitment fairs in various parts of the world throughout the year. Our fairs provide CIS Higher Education members the opportunity to engage with targeted groups of qualified undergraduate admission candidates. Institutions may customise their participation in a manner consistent with their own institutional objectives by individually registering for one or more of these events.
      </p>
      <h3>CIS FORUM ON INTERNATIONAL ADMISSION & GUIDANCE</h3>
      <p>
        The CIS Forum on International Admission & Guidance is an annual global gathering of university admission and recruitment officers and school guidance counsellors which offers unique opportunities to meet and exchange ideas about the admission processes, learn about current trends in international student recruitment and post-secondary admission and network with admission and guidance colleagues.
