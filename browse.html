    <h3>University Preparation - the CIS University Pathway Service</h3>
          <p>The CIS University Pathway Service is designed specifically to help and prepare our students to apply to and thrive at English-speaking universities or colleges.

In addition to intensive language and academic tuition of our Academic English programme, our trained university counsellors help you choose the right university or college programme. They assist you at every stage of the application process, from start to finish. At the same time, CIS's academic team work with you to design a study plan tailored to your needs and then monitor your progress to ensure that you achieve these goals wherever possible.</p>
