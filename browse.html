            <h1>University Preparation</h1>
            <p>
              At the High School, we take university preparation seriously to ensure the best possible outcome for the individual student as they look towards tertiary education. The college counselling staff advises students and parents on course choices in school, external testing, and guides their way through the application procedures of university systems around the world. Open communication is the key to successful applications and acceptance as student and family desires are matched with realistic academic and social choices. CIS arranges psychometric testing to help students decide what they'd like to do once they leave the High School. CIS offers after-school preparation for SAT preparation.Grade level meetings provide overviews of the variety of higher education options so that students are familiar with financial requirements, transcript and application processes, and course selection based on preferred country of study. We offer group sessions for UK UCAS registration or the USA Common Application.Since there are so many choices for students, we also invite universities and colleges to visit the school and allow students to engage with university staff in person to explore new options and get more experience with the college and university application process.
            </p>
            <h3>University Entrance Requirements</h3>
            <p>
              Students and parents need to be aware of the many different entrance requirements across the world, certainly by the end of Grade 10 as course choices for the final two years at CIS are critical. Many of our students select either the full IB Diploma Programme  often with a specified number of points in certain subjects  or a number of AP exams with a specified score. These requirements and their consequences are discussed in conjunction with students, parents and teachers with the college counselling staff.
            </p>
            <h3>Grade 10</h3>
            <p>
              Formal university preparation meetings begin in the 10th grade with students and parents discussing AP and IB syllabuses and the recommended/required subjects for various courses or countries. Parents and students are welcome to arrange meetings with the College Counsellor to address their needs, questions and concerns.
            </p>
            <h3>Grade 11</h3>
            <p>
              In the 11th grade, students are encouraged to attend university presentations and to start meeting regularly with the College Counsellor so that by the end of the year they have a short list of universities of which they intend to apply. This exploratory time is one for the student to focus on their learning styles, their aspirations, and to honestly self-evaluate strengths and challenges. Drafting university essays begins late in the year and juniors are encouraged to talk to seniors about their essays and advice on the application process.
            </p>
            <h3>Grade 12</h3>
            <p>
              The 12th grade is the time for applications. Depending on the country and the course, applications can be due as early as September of the senior year or as late as after graduation. Students are advised to ensure they are well-prepared and aware of deadlines. Parents should be aware that universities are in contact with the applicant and not the school, college counselling office or parents. Teachers and college counselling staff, particularly the subject specialists for UK applications, discuss university essays with students and provide advice on application processes. We encourage students to be true to themselves, and showcase their individuality and character that makes them likely candidates for admission to university.
            </p>
            <h3>IB Curriculum (Grades 11 & 12)</h3>
            <p>
              Students enrolled in the IB Diploma Programme complete the following course of study over two years, choosing one subject from each of the five core groups (groups 1-5) and one subject from group six (6), or alternatively a second subject from groups 1-5:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>First Language / Studies in Language & Literature (group 1)</li>
             <li>Additional Language / Language Acquisition (group 2)</li>
             <li>Individuals & Societies (group 3)</li>
             <li>Sciences (group 4)</li>
             <li>Mathematics (group 5)</li>
             <li>The Arts (group 6) or another subject from groups 1-5</li>
           </ul>
           <p>They must also complete three requirements that make up the core of the IB Diploma Programme:</p>
           <ul>
             <li>The Extended Essay an in-depth independent research project</li>
             <li>Theory of Knowledge a course on critical thinking and the nature of knowledge</li>
             <li>Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) a scheme of on-going commitment and experiential learning outside of the classroom. Examples of projects undertaken can be found on our Activities page.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Students finish the programme by taking externally marked written examinations, and by completing a variety of course and core assessments.</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            Students and their parents are aided in their choice of subjects throughout their pre-IB Diploma Programme years, or alternatively throughout the admissions process by our experienced teaching and counselling staff.Students who do not wish to enrol in the IB Diploma Programme are able to take IB Certificate examinations in subjects they choose.All students are simultaneously enrolled in the High School Diploma programme, which is seamlessly integrated into the IB coursework. Upon fulfilling the Institut Montana graduation requirements students receive a fully accredited American High School Diploma.
          </p>
          <h3>IGCSE Curriculum (Grades 9-10)</h3>
          <p>
            At this stage the curriculum is especially designed to prepare our students for IGCSE examinations. The International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) is an internationally recognised qualification for students aged 14 to 16. It enhances our students’ academic profile, and is highly regarded by many international universities, especially in the UK and Germany.Our IGCSE curriculum is also an ideal preparation for our IB Diploma Programme, teaching independent and in-depth study, and giving our students experiences with externally marked final examinations.A core requirement of our IGCSE curriculum is the Global Perspectives course, an interdisciplinary course teaching open-mindedness and critical thinking.
          </p>
          <h3>Foundation Years (Grades 7-8)</h3>
          <p>
            Our Foundation Years curriculum is designed to teach our students the fundamental skills required to be successful at IGCSE and IB Diploma stages. We challenge our students to become critical thinkers and life long learners as part of our school community – qualities required for success in later stages of education and throughout life.
          </p>
          <h3>Support, College Counselling, English as an Additional Language</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout their time at our school, our students are offered constant guidance and counselling. We offer specialised programmes for academic support, college counselling, and for students whose first language is not English through our English as an Additional Language (EAL) programme.
