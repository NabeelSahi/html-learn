            <h1>Why Teach Internationally</h1>
            <p>
              For those with a sense of adventure, a career in international education can be a uniquely rewarding experience, both professionally and personally. It can allow you to broaden your horizon, become immersed in a different culture and environment, and perhaps learn or improve a foreign language. It offers the opportunity to make many new friends and forge life-lasting ties as you join a professional and highly engaged global community of educators.International schools are often the ideal environments for improving your own educational practices and developing new skills in collaboration with your peers. Rich and varied professional development programmes are common benefits of working at an international school as are the availability of modern teaching resources and technology. An overseas teaching opportunity can allow you to engage with motivated students with high expectations and really have an impact on their development as global citizens. International schools frequently offer a comprehensive salary and benefits package that may provide higher remuneration than that offered by national or state schools.
            </p>
            <h3>What do schools look for in an international educator?</h3>
            <p>
              CIS Member Schools seek educators who have demonstrated success improving student learning and who actively collaborate in professional development networks. Strong IT skills and proven experience using technology as a tool to facilitate learning are increasingly expected. Equally important is the potential to adapt well to a new environment and culture; the ability to engage a diverse student population and the motivation to become involved with the wider community outside of the school. Cultural sensitivity and a tolerance for ambiguity are essential attributes. Successful international educators aspire to increase their own knowledge and understanding of global issues and trends; they are innately resourceful, flexible, engaging, with a sense of humour.

            <h3>Why Teach Overseas?</h3>
            <p>
              Teaching in an international school is one of the best kept secrets in the teaching profession. Thousands of candidates take their first position abroad thinking that it will be their last. Although this is true for some, many teachers make international education a career choice which opens up new horizons filled with excitement, discovery and fulfillment.
            </p>
            <h3>International Schools</h3>
            <p>
              International schools serve two main purposes: They offer expatriates the option of educating their children in a way that will prepare them for life in their home country, and they allow native students the chance to receive an international education that will prepare them for work or further study abroad. To this end, most international schools follow a globally standardized curriculum, like the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). Because international schools are almost always taught in English, they are a great option for English-speaking teachers looking to teach abroad.
