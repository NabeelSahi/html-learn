        <h1>International Education Careers</h1>
        <p>The Council of International Schools has more than 30 years experience helping school educators and leaders find opportunities in high quality schools around the world. Working with CIS provides educators with access to positions in more than 660 schools that offer an international education. Through the CIS Educator Database, an annual recruitment fair and custom leadership searches, educators and staff looking for new international positions can use CIS as a central resource.</p>
        <h3>We elevate and inform educational conversations worldwide</h3>
        <p>We are an influential voice for and with our member schools, helping them to reflect deeply and sometimes radically about their impact in their local context and in the world at large. As a visible thought leader and key influencer for and with our members on multiple educational stages, we aim not just to improve education, but to transform it, whether through speaking engagements, publications, or participation in think tanks. Through our commitment to influencing, we are building a broader set of norms, institutions, networks, associations, and systems.</p>

      <h3>For Students</h3>
      <p>CIS provides a way for secondary school students attending CIS Member Schools and other major national schools around the world to connect with CIS Member colleges and universities.
