       <h3>We help you to grow and adapt in uncertain times</h3>
       <p>Schools and systems around the world are trying to discover how to educate young people so that they acquire the knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and capabilities to live as active, productive, responsible, and participative citizens in modern societies.

The same applies to those owning, running, and working in these schools and systems.

With ever-diminishing half-lives of knowledge and skills, schools cannot limit themselves to the transmission of set content. Instead, they need to develop and promote flexibility, openness to new ideas, ability to adapt, and courage in the face of the unexpected.</p>
       <h3>School Leadership Positions</h3>
       <p>Member Schools work with CIS to promote leadership openings and to recruit specific senior leadership positions including Heads of Schools or Divisional Heads. School leaders are invited to take advantage of our free-of-charge recruitment service and establish an active portfolio which can be made available to schools searching for new leaders.</p>
       <h3>For Consultants & Supporting Organisations</h3>
       <p>ISE School and Higher Education Members look to ISE to help them identify and establish linkages with organisations and individuals who offer expertise in international education and who can support them in the development and enhancement of their programmes and services.</p>
