        <h3>Volunteer Committees & Teams</h3>
        <p>Members serving members is a vital aspect of CIS. The combined expertise of more than 3000 individuals representing over 1100 member schools and higher education institutions around the globe who serve on Volunteer Committees and Teams brings a wealth of experience and a truly international dimension to the work of the organisation. In turn, participation in CIS services and events provides colleagues in international education with valuable opportunities for professional and personal growth. Whether serving on an Accreditation Visiting Team, leading a University Counsellor Tour or a College and University Tour, or advising CIS on current research in international education, members supporting and connecting with other members is the core of the CIS mission.</p>
