            <h3>What are International Schools</h3>
            <p>
              An international school is a school that promotes international education, in an international environment, either by adopting a curriculum such as that of the International Baccalaureate, Edexcel or Cambridge International Examinations, or by following a national curriculum different from that of the school's country of residence.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Excellence in education for globally-minded students.</p>
